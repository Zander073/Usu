# Using the application (currently)
- Upon using the application, the program will read through a transaction history file and use that history to determine what the user's present day portfolio is. Such portfolio will include the user's positions (the stocks they own) and their cash balance.
- Users can trade stocks (buy and sell) within their limits and at real time prices. 
- Users may also observe stock quotes and study them to determine if they want to invest in them.
